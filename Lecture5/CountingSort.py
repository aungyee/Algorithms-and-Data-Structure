# ------------------------- Counting Sort ----------------------------- #
# To solve the problem of duplicate keys in direct access array sort,
#   we simply link a chain to each direct access array index, just like in hashing.
# When multiple items have the same key, we store them both in the chain associated with their key.
# Later, it will be important that this algorithm be stable:
#   that items with duplicate keys appear in the same order in the output as the input.
# Thus, we choose chains that will support a sequence queue interface to keep items in order,
# inserting to the end of the queue, and then returning items back in the order that they were inserted.

    Sort A assuming non-negative key

    u = 1 + max([x.key for x in A])                             # O(n)
    D = [[] for i in range(u)]                                  # O(u)

        for x in chain:
            A[i] = x

# Counting sort takes -
#   O(u) time to initialize the chains of the direct access array, O(n) time to insert all the elements,
#   and then O(u) time to scan back through the direct access array to return the items;
#   so the algorithm runs in O(n + u) time.
# Again, when u = O(n), then counting sort runs in linear time, but this time allowing duplicate keys.


# Thereâ€™s another implementation of counting sort which just keeps track of how many of each key map to each index,
#   and then moves each item only once, rather the implementation above -
#   which moves each item into a chain and then back into place.
# The implementation below computes the final index location of each item via cumulative sums.
